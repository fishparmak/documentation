This is the component of the headings on the site. 
You can either add class "heading" to your <h1> tag in heading.html to get main heading of the header of the site, 
or add another class "heading_paragraphs" to get heading of the paragraphs on site.
You also can play with text alignment by adding necessary "heading_center" or "heading_right" to align your paragraphs.
